    <string name="delhi_intro">\t\t\tDelhi seems like a colorful, cosmic swirl. India\'s capital and second-largest city is in constant motion â€” whether it\'s with people and cultures or religions and history.\n\t\t\tAnd that makes it an ideal destination for the traveler who enjoys complexity and multicultural trips. Whether you\'re enjoying the historic and sometimes chaotic vibe of Old Delhi or the emerging dynamic modernism of the government district in New Delhi, you\'ll never be bored.
